# Yankee-Met-Fan-Locations-Via-Taxi-Data

This is a quick project I did for an interview that ended up landing me the job!  I was given a week to utilize any data from NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) to try and answer some interesting questions and give a 10 or 15 minute presentation.

I took a look at NYC Taxi data after Yankees and Mets games to show where people headed to after the games.  I utilized a single class support vector machine to try to normalize the traffic data and remove what was considered ordinary traffic not caused by the games themselves.  I then produced choropleth maps of what the model believed was traffic cause by games to show where people where heading.  

Please see the pdf file included in the repo as the output for the presentation I gave during the interview.
